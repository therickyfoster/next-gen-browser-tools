## 🚀 Quick Start

### For General Users
1. **Browse the Catalog**: Open `REPORT.md` to explore tools by profession
2. **Find Your Use Case**: Check the demo scenarios for your field
3. **Try Tools Safely**: All tools vetted for security and privacy
4. **Go Offline**: Many tools work without internet connection

### For Developers
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/next-gen-browser-tools.git

# Load the dataset
import toolsData from './tools.json';

# Filter by criteria
const webgpuTools = toolsData.tools.filter(tool => 
  tool.tech_stack.includes('WebGPU')
);

# Export to your format
const csvData = generateCSV(toolsData.tools);
```

### For Researchers
```javascript
// Analyze adoption trends
const adoptionStats = {
  webgpu: toolsData.technology_adoption.webgpu.percentage,
  wasm: toolsData.technology_adoption.webassembly.percentage,
  pwa: toolsData.technology_adoption.pwa.percentage
};

// Performance comparisons
const performanceData = toolsData.tools.map(tool => ({
  name: tool.name,
  category: tool.category,
  ratings: tool.ratings
}));
```
